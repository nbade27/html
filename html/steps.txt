there are some kind of formatting tags in html

Always use layout tags that used for better searching for search engines.

So finally I want you to make your code more readable.
for this we need to divide based on tags so these are called formatting tags


Link : we can use a tag to relate an url to a website from ur web page
also we can access a file(img/html) in your system

Note: In addition to setting both the width and height, you can choose to only set either the width OR the height.
By only setting one, HTML will automatically adjust the aspect ration for you.
So if you only set width="100",
HTML will automatically resize the height correctly

We also have video tag in html it has some attributes you can check it.
In some places we have found that youtube video is playing in browser it is because of iframe Tag so that you can see video in browser

div and span are containers 

There are two types of elements in html 
    1.Block elements(Paragraph tag) these will sit down to each other in line
    2.Inline elements(anchor tags ) these will sit next to each other in line

    In the same way spans are inline containers and div are block containers.
    


div is used to wrap some of html tags in one tag

input tags these are used to allow user to enter data in html elements
Ex: text box,text area, radio buttons etc.

The manin difference between checkbox and radio button is that 
we can select all checkboxes at a time 
but we cannot check radio buttons of same name at a time
